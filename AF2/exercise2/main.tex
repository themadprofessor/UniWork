  \begin{questions}
    \question[4]
      Let $a$ and $b$ be integers and let $m$ be a positive integer.  Show that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ if and only if $a \pmod{m} = b \pmod{m}$. Explain your steps.

    \question[2]
    Using the Euclidean Algorithm, find $\gcd(1529,14038)$. Show your working.
    \begin{solution}
	    \begin{eqnarray*}
		    14038 &=& 9  \cdot 1529 + 277 \\
		    1529  &=& 5  \cdot 277  + 144 \\
		    277   &=& 1  \cdot 144  + 133 \\
		    144   &=& 1  \cdot 133  + 11  \\
		    133   &=& 12 \cdot 11   + 1   \\
		    11    &=& 1  \cdot 11   + 0   \\
	    \end{eqnarray*}

	    Since 1 is the last remainder which is non-zero, $\gcd(1529,14038) = 1$.
    \end{solution}
    \question[5]
    Using the universe of all students, write out the following argument using quantifiers, connectives, and symbols to stand for propositions as necessary, explaining which rules of inference are used for each step. 

    \begin{quote}
    ``All $\mathit{AF2}$ students are second years.  There exists a $\mathit{AF2}$ student from Glasgow.  Therefore, there is a second year student from Glasgow.''
    \end{quote}
    {\bf Note:} there can be more than one student from Glasgow and this must be reflected in the construction of your argument.
    \begin{solution}
	    \begin{align*}
		    G              &= \text{the set of all students at Glasgow} \\
		    \mathit{AF}(x) &= \text{x takes AF2} \\
		    \mathit{S}(x)  &= \text{x is in second year} \\
            \end{align*}
	    $$\forall x.G(\mathit{AF}(x) \to \mathit{S}(x))$$

    \question[3]
        
    The $n {\times} n$ matrix $A$ is called a \emph{diagonal matrix} if $a_{i,j}=0$ for all $1 {\leq} i {\neq} j {\leq} n$.
    \\ \\
    Show that the product of two $n {\times} n$ diagonal matrices is diagonal and give an simple expression for the diagonal values of the product.
    \begin{solution}
	    Let $A$,$B$ be \(n \times n\) diagonal matrices, meaning \(a_{i,j}=b_{i,j}=0\) for all \(1 \leq i \neq j \leq n\).
	    So,
	    \(A \times B = C = [c_{i,j}] \equiv [\sum_{r=1}^{n} a_{i,r} \cdot b_{r,j}]\)
	    Since, when \(i \neq j\), \(a_{i,r}=b_{r,j}i=0\), it follows \(a_{i,r} \cdot b_{r,j}=0\) when \(i \neq j\).
	    Therefore only the values \(a_{i,r}\) and \(b_{j,r}\) are needed when \(i=j\), so \(C\) is diagonal.\\\\
	    The diagonal of \(C\) is defined as \(c_{i,j} = a_{i,j} \cdot b_{i,j}\) for all \(1 \leq i=j \leq n\).
         \end{solution}

    \question[5]
    
    Show that $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational if $n$ is a positive integer that is not a perfect square.

    {\bf Note}: an integer $n$ is a perfect square if $n=k^2$ for some integer $k$.  
    {\bf Hint:} use a proof by contradiction, together with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic considering the powers of the primes in the product.
    \begin{solution}
      %%%%% YOUR SOLUTION TO QUESTION 5 BEGINS HERE >>>>>
      Suppose $n$ is a perfect square and \(\sqrt{n}\) is irrational.
      This means there exists \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(n=k^2\) and there does not exists \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) where \(a \neq b\) and \(b \neq 0\) where \(\sqrt{n}=a/b\).

      \begin{align*}
	      n &= k^2 & & \\
	        &= (\prod_{u=0}^{v}p_{u}^{w_u})^2 \text{ where } & &u,v,w \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \\
	        &                                                & &\text{and } p_i \text{ is a prime such that } p_{i-1} < p_i < p_{i+1} \\
		& & &\text{using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic} \\
	      \sqrt{m} &= \prod_{u=0}^{v}p_{u}^{w_u} & \\
      \end{align*}
      This means \(\sqrt{n}\) can be written as a product of primes which implies it is an integer, so \(\sqrt{n}\) is rational.
      This is a contradiction, hence \(\sqrt{n}\) is irrational if $n$ is not a perfect square.
    \end{solution}
    \question[5]
    The Fibonacci numbers $f_0, f_1, f_2,\dots$ and Lucas numbers $l_0, l_1, l_2, \dots$ are defined by the equations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $f_0=0$, $f_1=1$ and $f_n = f_{n-1} {+} f_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq 2$;
    \item
    $l_0=2$, $l_1=1$ and $l_n = l_{n-1} {+} l_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq 2$
    \end{itemize}
    respectively. Prove that $f_{n} {+} f_{n+2} = l_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq 1$.
    \begin{solution}
	    Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $f_{n} {+} f_{n+2} = l_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq 1$.\\
	    Base case: $P(1)$ is true since,
	    \begin{align*}
		    f_1 + f_3     &= l_2   & \\
		    1+f_1 +f_0 +1 &= 1 + 2 & \text{by definition of }f_n \text{ and } l_n \\
		    1+1+0+1       &= 1+2   & \text{by definition of }f_0 \text{ and } f_1 \\
		    3             &= 3     & \\
	    \end{align*}
	    Inductive step: Assume $P(k)$ is true for some arbitary $k$. Now considering $k+1$ we have:
	    \begin{align*}
		    \text{lhs} &= f_{k+1} + f_{k+3} & \\
		               &= f_k + f_{k-1} + f_{k+2} + f_{k+1} & \text{by definition of }f_n \\
			       &= (f_k + f_{k+2}) + (f_{k-1} + f_{k+1} & \text{rearranging} \\
			       &= l_{k+1} + l_k                        & \text{by the inductive hypothosis} \\
			       &= l_{k+2}                              & \text{by definition of }l_n \\
			       &= \text{rhs} & \\
	    \end{align*}
	    Therefore by the principle of induction we have proved $P(n)$ for all $n\geq 1$.
    \end{solution}

    \question
    The set of bit strings $\mathbb{B}^*$ are be defined recursively by:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{B}^*$ (where $\varepsilon$ is the empty string);
    \item
    if $w \in \mathbb{B}^*$ and $x \in \{0,1\}$, then $wx \in \mathbb{B}^*$. 
    \end{itemize}
    We can define concatenation of two bit strings denoted ${+}{+}$, recursively as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    if $w \in \mathbb{B}^*$, then $w {+}{+} \varepsilon = w$;
    \item
    if $w,v \in \mathbb{B}^*$ and $x \in \{0,1\}$, then $w{+}{+}(vx) = (w{+}{+}v)x$. 
    \end{itemize}
    {\bf Notice the difference in the above recursive definitions and those given for strings in the lectures. Then consider how this will influence how to prove properties of bit strings by structural induction.}
    \begin{parts}
    \part[2]
    Give a recursive definition of the function $\mathtt{ones} : \mathbb{B}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ which counts the number of ones in a bit string.
    \begin{solution}
	    If \(\varepsilon \in \mathtt{B}*\), then \(\mathtt{ones}(\varepsilon)=0\)\\
	    If \(w \in \mathtt{B}*, x \in [0,1]\), then \(\mathtt{ones}(wx)=\mathtt{ones}(w) + 1\)
    \end{solution}
    \part[4]
    Use structural induction to prove that $\mathtt{ones}(w{+}{+}v) = \mathtt{ones}(w) + \mathtt{ones}(v)$ for all $w, v \in \mathbb{B}^*$.
    \begin{solution}
	    Let \(w=\varepsilon\)
	    \begin{align*}
		    \mathtt{ones}(\varepsilon {+}{+} w) &= \mathtt{ones}(w) & \text{by defintion}\\
		                                        &= 0 + \mathtt{ones}(w) & \text{rearranging} \\
			                                &= \mathtt{ones}(\varepsilon) + \mathtt{ones}(w) & \text{by defintion of \(\mathtt{ones}(\varepsilon)\)} \\
	    \end{align*}
	    Let \(w,v \in \varepsilon\), \(x \in \varepsilon\) and \(v=v'x\).
	    \begin{align*}
		    \text{lhs} &= \mathtt{ones}(w{+}{+}) & \\
		               &= \mathtt{ones}(w{+}{+}(v'x)) & \\
			       &= \mathtt{ones}((w{+}{+}v')x) & \text{by defintion of concationation} \\
			       &= \mathtt{ones}(w{+}{+}v') + 1  & \text{by defintion of $\mathtt{ones}$} \\
			       &= \mathtt{ones}(w)+\mathtt{ones}(v')+1 & \text{by inductive hypothesis} \\
			       &= \mathtt{ones}(w)+\mathtt{ones}(v) & \text{by definitions of $\mathtt{ones}$ and \(v=v'x\)} \\
			       &= \text{rhs} & \\
	    \end{align*}
