  %%%%% QUESTIONS BEGIN HERE. PLEASE EDIT INDICATED SECTIONS %%%%%
  \begin{questions}
    \question[4]
      Let $a$ and $b$ be integers and let $m$ be a positive integer.  Show that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ if and only if $a \pmod{m} = b \pmod{m}$. Explain your steps.
    \begin{solution}
      %%%%% YOUR SOLUTION TO QUESTION 1 GOES HERE >>>>>
      Remember that the dollar sign \$ acts as a bracket, which allows you to enter and leave math mode.
      Some features of latex are only available inside the math mode. Your solution should include a good balance of mathematical equations and English commentary.
           
      This is how you can typeset a remainder from division by m: $a \pmod{m} = b \pmod{m}$
      
      This is how you can typeset a multiplication symbol: $\cdot$
      
      This is how you can typeset a sequence of arithmetic operations linked with an equality operator, and include the important commentary for each step:
      
      \begin{align*}
        a & = a     & \mbox{by reflexivity of equality} \\
          & = 0 + a & \mbox{by additive identity} \\
      \end{align*}
      
      This is how you can typeset ``a divides b'': $a | b$
      
      This is how you can typeset the triple equality symbol, and various left and right inequalities: $\equiv$, $\leq$, $<$, $>$, $\geq$
      
      
      Do not worry if your solution doesn't use these symbols, or uses other symbols.
      There are many different ways to solve each task, which may all use slightly different terminology.
      
      The source latex file and pdf for a selection of proofs taken from the tutorial exercises on moodle should also help with typesetting each of your answers.

    \question[2]
    Using the Euclidean Algorithm, find $\gcd(1529,14038)$. Show your working.
    \begin{solution}
	    \begin{eqnarray*}
		    14038 &=& 9  \cdot 1529 + 277 \\
		    1529  &=& 5  \cdot 277  + 144 \\
		    277   &=& 1  \cdot 144  + 133 \\
		    144   &=& 1  \cdot 133  + 11  \\
		    133   &=& 12 \cdot 11   + 1   \\
		    11    &=& 1  \cdot 11   + 0   \\

	    \end{eqnarray*}

	    Since 1 is the last remainder which is non-zero, $\gcd(1529,14038) = 1$
    \end{solution}
    \question[5]
    Using the universe of all students, write out the following argument using quantifiers, connectives, and symbols to stand for propositions as necessary, explaining which rules of inference are used for each step. 

    \begin{quote}
    ``All $\mathit{AF2}$ students are second years.  There exists a $\mathit{AF2}$ student from Glasgow.  Therefore, there is a second year student from Glasgow.''
    \end{quote}
    {\bf Note:} there can be more than one student from Glasgow and this must be reflected in the construction of your argument.
    \begin{solution}
      %%%%% YOUR SOLUTION TO QUESTION 3 BEGINS HERE >>>>>
      In this question you may want to use the align environment as in question 1. 

      Logical connectives and quantifiers can be typeset like this: $\exists$, $\forall$, $\land$, $\lor$.

      For propositions inside math mode, you can use the following notation: $\mathit{AF}(x)$.

    \question[3]
        
    The $n {\times} n$ matrix $A$ is called a \emph{diagonal matrix} if $a_{i,j}=0$ for all $1 {\leq} i {\neq} j {\leq} n$.
    \\ \\
    Show that the product of two $n {\times} n$ diagonal matrices is diagonal and give an simple expression for the diagonal values of the product.
    \begin{solution}
      %%%%% YOUR SOLUTION TO QUESTION 4 BEGINS HERE >>>>>
      To typeset matrix multiplication you can use $\times$, to typeset subscripts, you can use $a_{i, j}$. For superscripts, you can use $a^{i, j}$.

      For the finite summation and product operators, you can use respectively $\sum_{i=0}^{10}$ and $\prod_{i=0}^{10}$.

    \question[5]
    
    Show that $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational if $n$ is a positive integer that is not a perfect square.

    {\bf Note}: an integer $n$ is a perfect square if $n=k^2$ for some integer $k$.  
    {\bf Hint:} use a proof by contradiction, together with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic considering the powers of the primes in the product.
    \begin{solution}
      %%%%% YOUR SOLUTION TO QUESTION 5 BEGINS HERE >>>>>
      To typeset a square root, you can use $\sqrt{n}$.

    The Fibonacci numbers $f_0, f_1, f_2,\dots$ and Lucas numbers $l_0, l_1, l_2, \dots$ are defined by the equations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $f_0=0$, $f_1=1$ and $f_n = f_{n-1} {+} f_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq 2$;

    $l_0=2$, $l_1=1$ and $l_n = l_{n-1} {+} l_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq 2$

    \question
    The set of bit strings $\mathbb{B}^*$ are be defined recursively by:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{B}^*$ (where $\varepsilon$ is the empty string);
    \item
    if $w \in \mathbb{B}^*$ and $x \in \{0,1\}$, then $wx \in \mathbb{B}^*$. 
    \end{itemize}
    We can define concatenation of two bit strings denoted ${+}{+}$, recursively as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    if $w \in \mathbb{B}^*$, then $w {+}{+} \varepsilon = w$;
    \item
    if $w,v \in \mathbb{B}^*$ and $x \in \{0,1\}$, then $w{+}{+}(vx) = (w{+}{+}v)x$. 
    \end{itemize}
    {\bf Notice the difference in the above recursive definitions and those given for strings in the lectures. Then consider how this will influence how to prove properties of bit strings by structural induction.}
    \begin{parts}
    \part[2]
    Give a recursive definition of the function $\mathtt{ones} : \mathbb{B}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ which counts the number of ones in a bit string.
    \begin{solution}

      You can refer to the function from the description of the task as $\mathtt{ones}$, the set of bit strings as $\mathbb{B}^*$.
