\title{IT professional issues raise by Twitter's unintentional incorrect use of personal information}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
On the 8th of October 2019, Twitter delivered a public apology for unintentionally using user's personally information incorrectly \parencite{support_twitter_2019}.
\textcite{support_personal_2019} states email addresses and phone numbers use for safety or security purposes had been inadvertently used for advertising purposes.
This raises issues such a privacy concerns for users, security concerns, and data protection issues.

\section{Privacy Issues}
By allowing third-party advertisers to gain access to personal information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, user's privacy has been breached.
A user has the right to be control the manner in which their data is used, which is outlined in \textcite{twitter_privacy_2018}.
This right was not upheld by this breach, since the user submitted the data for a specific purpose, security or safety, but Twitter utilised the data for other purposes, advertising.

One could see this a Twitter attempting to capitalise on extra data submitted by its user based in order to increase profits, and relations with advertising companies
\textcite{support_personal_2019} and \textcite{support_twitter_2019} both claim this is not the case, as it was inadvertent and unintentional.
Furthermore, such a business strategy is detrimental to the long term public view of Twitter, since such an act would eventually be made public, destroying their public image.
As such, this is unlikely to be the case.

\section{Data Protection Issues}
Twitter is a company whose user base spans the glob, therefore Twitter must abide by a range of data protection laws.
For example, for Twitter to operate within the UK, they must abide by \textcite{parliament_of_the_united_kingdom_data_2018} and \textcite{noauthor_regulation_2016}.
These laws are in place to protect data held by companies about individuals, which Twitter failed to uphold with allowing access to data to parties who should not have access.

One could deem Twitter's actions to be in breach of \textcite{noauthor_regulation_2016}.
\textcite{noauthor_regulation_2016} states personal data shall be processed in a transparent manner, meaning the user who's data is being process must be informed of how the data is being processed.
In this case, users were information the data in question was to be held for the sole use of user account security and safety.
Twitter made use of the data in question for advertising purposes, which was not divulged to users.
On the other hand, \textcite{support_personal_2019} claims allowing access to the data was inadvertent, which does not breach \textcite{noauthor_regulation_2016}.
Since this was not a breach of security, rather a internal mistake, it is not protected by \textcite{noauthor_regulation_2016}
Moreover, Twitter responsibly resolved the issue and informed its users in a timely manner \parencite{support_twitter_2019}, although Twitter has not directly informed users who's data was incorrectly handled. 

\section{Ethical Issues}
Ethically, one could view the incorrect use of user's personal data as a terrible action by Twitter, since they have betrayed the trust of their users.
When data is given over to a company, the user providing the data is placing their trust in the company to make use of the data in the manner they describe.
Twitter failed to uphold this trust, and as such has failed their users.
Assuming \textcite{support_twitter_2019} is correct in stating this was unintentional, the loss of trust in Twitter should be minimal as the company is ran by humans, and the platform was built by humans.
Unlike machines, humans make mistakes, and users should trust in companies to correctly handle such mistakes by resolving the issue as soon as possible, and inform their users promptly.

On the other hand, one could view this as an ethically sound situation, because the data was given to Twitter, and Twitter should be allowed to make use of the data as they deem fit.
This would be a valid view to hold if \textcite{twitter_privacy_2018} did not outline the data Twitter can share with third-party companies.
The data outlined does not include email addresses or phone numbers, therefore such data should not have been disclosed to any third-parties.
