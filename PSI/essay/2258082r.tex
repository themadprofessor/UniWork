\title{The implications of face-swapping applications}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Face-swapping applications are applications which can superimpose one person's face onto another.
These types of applications are not new, for example the \cite{blanz04} successfully created a system to exchange faces, but have raised important issues through their ease of use and rapid growth in use.
Until recently, the applications required large sets of training data in order to produce a reasonable output, but now a reasonable output can be created from as little as 1 image as training data in the case of the Chinese mobile application Zao.
Furthermore, applications like these raise the issue of ownership of likeness, does someone own the rights to their own face.
