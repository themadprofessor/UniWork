Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous commodity in recent years, providing
continuous access to information and communication. This has had a profound
impact on our society. They allow for a new style of communication which has
instant feedback from either the recipient or a collection of third parties,
depending on if direct communication is used. They allow for unrivaled access
to information instantly, which would have been impossible only a few decades
ago. One could take the stance mobile phones have replaced in-person
communication, and as such society is slowly losing understanding of more
subtle, non-verbal communication. While it is true mobile phones are replacing
in-person communication in some instances, they have not completely replaced it.
Formal communication is unlikely to be replaced, but casual communication has
been partial replaced. This is not an issue as more communication opportunities
have been made possible by the use of mobile phones, allowing in-person
communication to happen more frequently.
