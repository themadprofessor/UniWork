# CP(M) Exercise 1

## Model

The model is defined as a 2D array of integers called teams, where the rows are the teams and the
columns are the students. Each element in the grid is either 1 if the student is in the team, and
0 otherwise. Each student must be in only one single team, so the sum of all student's columns must
equal 1. All teams must be either empty, or within the upper and lower bounds. This is defined as
the set of 0 and all values between the upper and lower bounds, so the sum of each team's row must
be in this set of values. To ensure students which must be together or apart are in the same team
or not respectively, for each pair the sum of their values on every row must be either less than 2
if they are to be apart, or in the set of 0 and 2 if they are to be together. For students to be
together, their sum must be 0 or 2, because either they are both in the team or are not. The sum
must be less than 2 for students which must be apart, because either neither are in the team or
at most one of them. To minimise the number of teams used, the variable non_empty_teams is defined
to be the number of teams whose row sums to a non-zero value. Any team with a row which sums to 0
contains no students, so is empty. This value is then minimised to find the optimal solution with
the minimal number of teams used.

## Symmetries

The ordering of teams does not matter. For example if team 1 contained Alex and Steve, and team 2
contained Bob and Finn, then this is the same solution if the teams were switched. This symmetry
is removed by ensuring all teams with a lower number than a team are lexicographically greater than
or equal to the team.

## Typical Performance

The model was able to find an optimal solution for the small dataset in 66 nodes, 1124 for the
medium dataset and the large dataset didn't complete within a reasonable length of time. A node is
a possible solution the solver attempts to fit the constraints.
