2. Report
   
    - Description of your model, stating the variables, their domains
      and what those variables actually mean. [15]
    - Describe the constraints used, and what they actually mean. [5]
    - For a problem with n courses and m periods, what will be the size of your model?
      That is, how does the model size grow with problem input? [5]
    - Describe any variable and value ordering heuristics used. Also, identify your
      decision variables.  [5]
    - Give a brief report on your computational experience solving and optimizing the problems. [10]
    - Briefly describe at least one alternative model that might be considered. [10]
