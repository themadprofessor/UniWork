\section{Overview}
Release It! is a guide on how a programmer can design a system which is designed for production 
from the outset of development, while providing case studies to show real-world examples of why
this is important.
The book is broken into four chapters; Create Stability, Design for Production, Deliver Your 
System, Solve Systemic Problems.
Each of these chapters are further broken down in multiple sections, starting with a case study,
followed by multiple sections, focusing on the solutions to the issues found in the case study.
Breaking each chapter into multiple sections in this structure allows the chapter to have a flow
from showing there is an issue and its implications, to possible solutions and how to apply the
solutions to the reader's own systems.
The chapters also provide an overarching flow of how to handle the failure of a system and 
minimising the impact of the failure, reducing the likelihood of a failure in a system,
deploying a system in a manner to reduce the likelihood of failure, and how to handle a failure
in production.
By the end of the book, the reader should have an understanding of why it is important and how to 
design a system for production early in the system's development, and have a systematic method to 
resolve a failure in production.
