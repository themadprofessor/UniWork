For this report, I am comparing my experiences with Haskell and
Python.  In particular, I have used the Scalpel scraping library in
Haskell, and the equivalent scrapy library in Python.

Code size: Functional code in general (and Haskell in particular) is
  highly concise. This comes from powerful features like higher order
  functions on lists- much more concise than for/while loop
  control-flow structures in Python. Also, high-level operators and
  functions are provided in the standard libraries (like Data.List).


Code readability: While Haskell code is particularly dense, it can be
  difficult to read sometimes. Meaningful variable names might help.


Code maintainability:
  Bug fixes? Comments?


Toolchain support: Does stack work as well as pip? Is there as much
  online support for Haskell as for Python? Does this affect developer
  productivity at all?
